---
## Traditional NLP

* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Naive Bayes Sentiment Analysis
* Randomized Singular Value Decomposition **

---
## Computer Vision Transfer Learning

* ImageNet Model

* Fine Tune for Target Problem

## Transfer Learning for Vision

[New Model Modified from Existing Vision Model](./nbs/review-cv-transfer.pdf)

---
## Neural Net NLP

* Language Model
* Transfer Learning for Text
* seq2seq translation
* Attention
* Transformer
---
## Language Model

the quick brown _______

|

Train on self-supervised, easy to capture, text dataset

Any text documents will work

Like wikitext-103
---
## Text Transfer Learning

* New Language Model (LM) Modified from Existing LM 

* Add Classifier

## More Detailed Example: NLP Transfer Learning

[NLP Transfer learning](./nbs/5-nn-imdb.pdf)

* Counting Bottles on Shelf 

---
## State of the Art Tradeoff

* Bigger Corpuses

* More Parameters

* Bigger Memory, More Processing
